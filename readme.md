<span style="text-align:left;">
  
* lay out a nested array to be used as the gameboard and then fill it with 1's and 0's to design the basic layout
  
* randomize the starting positions of the point pellets
* prepare all of the necessary items like high-score, lifepoints, and x,y grid-positions for the player and enemies
* layout the grid on screen to test how it works. 1 fills a block with black background color and 0 leaves the background color untouched
* design the player's movement to check the player's current position and only move to the user's desired direction if that block is marked with the number 0
* design the point pellets to generate on random 0's and detect whether the user has come in contact with them
* design the score system and set it to increase by 5 for each point pellet that is picked up by the player. every 100 points will grant the player another lifepoint
* let the enemies travel around the grid using only 0s by checking their surrounding every time they move and choosing their movement direction based on the player's position
* check during every move if the enemies have collided with the player and if they have, remove 1 life from the player and set the player to lose should their remaining lives reach 0
* setup the winning and losing/dying animations
* setup the start button and add animations for the characters and point balls
* set up a reset function to reset everything once the player runs out of lives or wants to start over
